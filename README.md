# Battleship

This is a project I read about in "Head First JavaScript Programming" using basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript. It looked like a lot of fun so I decided to give it a shot!

## Overview

After focusing on React development for the past few months, I got interested in the book and this project in order to brush up on my JavaScript fundamentals. By the time this project is finished, you will be able to play an interactive Battleship game where you guess the location of enemy ships on a grid and try to sink them.
